Here, my primary goal was to create the validation form from scratch without utilizing any third-party libraries, such as Zod. In order to save the user from having to reload the page, the reset button was also introduced to empty the input field value.

And I'll use the React Form Hook with Zod for future implementation. in order to prevent the validation form from being implemented manually.
